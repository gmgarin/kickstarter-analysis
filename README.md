## Overview of Project

### Purpose
#### The purpose of this analsyis is to help Louise compare her play "Fever" fundraiding to other fundraising projects from the same category.Specifically, this analysis focuses on campaigns based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

#### The analysis of theater category for crowdfunding based on launch date covers the year 2009 through 2017. Data shows that out 1369 projects, 839 were successful, 493 were failed, and 37 were canceled. In addition, further analysis also shows the highest number of successful theater-related projects were done in the months of May and June. The month of May also has the highest number of failed projects.The year 2015 has highest number of projects created with a total of 518 projects, 318 of which were successful.

#### The analysis of theater plays crowdfunding based on goals shows that projects with a goal of $4999  or less have higher success rate than those projects with $5000 or greater goal. In addition, as the goal amount increases, the number of projects decreases. There is also a general decrease in success rate as the amount of goal increases.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
#### The analysis part is easy when the data are summarized and organized. But before this part, the process was very tedious and time consuming, especially for beginners like myself. I found myself stuck in filtering and writing formulas, specifically in the second analysis. It took me several hours searching through the module and on the internet. Once, I learned how to do it, it got easier and it made me feel more confident.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

*Based on the data, theater crowdfounding projects are likely to be successful when launched in the months of May or June. It also shows that crowdfunding projects in the theater category has approximately 60% success rate.*

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 *The data show that theater crowdfunding projects with smaller goal amounts have higher success rate than those with bigger goal amounts.* 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
*The data used in this analysis are only limited to the launch date and outcomes based on goals. Other variables that could have influence on this analysis, are countries, play genres, and total duration of the campaigns. Since these variables were not included, Louise cannot have a clear comparison between her campaign and other campaigns.*

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
*One graph that could be used based on this dataset is bar graph. We could represent success rate based on goal amounts. We could also creat a table to compare campaigns of different countries.*
